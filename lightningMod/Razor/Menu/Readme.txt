[Verified as working with TH version 21.3.31.3, API version 9.2]

Menu Plugin System is a framework for showing, hiding and docking Labels as interactive menu panels.


FEATURES:
Menus can be dragged to a variety of docking areas that border the screen. 

Their menu panels are also pinnable and repositionable by dragging, via integration with the Movable Plugin System. 

All of these customizations are saved automatically to file as you make them and are loaded the next time you run TurboHUD. 

Included with the distribution is:
- a plugin management menu to allow you to enable or disable plugins on-the-fly in-game
- a plugin management menu to allow you to enable or disable menu addons on-the-fly in-game
- a basic volume control panel
- RunStats - a suite of menu addons that offers data displays and statistics related to various aspects of playing the game
